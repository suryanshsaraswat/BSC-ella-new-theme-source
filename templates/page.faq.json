            "question_3": "Q: “Can I buy the kit without setting up subscription?”",

            "question_4": "Q: “Why are your products more expensive compared to other shaving products in the market?”",
            "answer_4": "<p>We believe in delivering premium quality grooming products to our customers like our razor which is an extremely precise engineered machine. Hence, the higher price.

Over the long term, we believe our grooming regimen is much higher value for money when compared to any other brand.<\/p>",

            "answer_5": "<p>Thanks for choosing our products for your gifting needs.

            "answer_8": "<p>No we do not currently provide COD. However, we are figuring out a way to launch it in the future. We currently provide payment options for credit, debit and other popular portals. All our payment gateways are 128-bit SSL encrypted.<\/p>",

            "question_1": "How does subscription work?",
            "answer_1": "<p>Once you have logged in to your account on our website you can set up a subscription plan. The plan currently only pertains to our shaving range of products but we will add other products to it in the future. After you buy the 6-Part Shaving System, you can subscribe to the 4 shaving supplies we will refill - Feather blades, Pre-Shave Scrub, Shaving Cream and Post-Shave Balm. Each of these products will last 70-80 shaves. Once you tell us how often you shave, we will estimate the depletion rate of these products and automatically replenish them for you.<\/p>",
            "question_2": "Is the subscription flexible?",
            "answer_2": "<p>Absolutely. You can choose which products you want and at what frequency you want them replenished. You can pause and restart the subscription any time as well as shift the date of your next replenishment. You can also cancel the subscription at any time.<\/p>",
            "question_3": "What is Auto-debit?",
            "answer_3": "<p>Auto-debit pertains to the amount that is deducted from your PayTM wallet as your replenishment date approaches. This amount is calculated based on your subscription plan. For example, if you choose to replenish a Pre-Shave Scrub, Shaving Cream and Post-Shave Balm the total sum of their MRPs would be deducted from your PayTM wallet 5-6 days before delivery.<\/p>",
            "question_4": "Why do I need to setup a Paytm wallet to subscribe?",
            "answer_4": "<p>The Rs 1 transaction is to ensure that your PayTM Wallet is linked to our backend and the subscription is activated. We will refund the Rs. 1 to you in the form of referral credits in your account.<\/p>",
            "question_5": "What if my wallet is debited when not desired?",
            "answer_5": "<p>Get in touch with us at the earliest and we will refund the payment.<\/p>",
            "question_6": "Can I use a different wallet other than PayTM?",

            "question_7": "How do I cancel my subscription?",
            "answer_7": "<p>First login to your account on our website. Next, go to the 'Settings' section in your account, navigate to the bottom of the page and click on 'Cancel my Subscription.'<\/p>",
            "question_8": "How do I modify my subscription?",
            "answer_8": "<p>After you login to your account on our website, go to the 'My Account' section. You will be able to modify your subscription under the 'My Subscription' tab.<\/p>",
            "question_9": "Why can I only subscribe to shaving supplies?",
